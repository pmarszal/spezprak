Class scrbook Warning: Usage of deprecated font command `\bf'!
(scrbook)              You should note, that in 1994 font command `\bf' has
(scrbook)              been defined for compatiblitiy to Script 2.0 only.
(scrbook)              Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, you
(scrbook)              shouldn't use such commands any longer and within
(scrbook)              KOMA-Script usage of `\bf' is definitely deprecated.
(scrbook)              See `fntguide.pdf' for more information about

(scrbook)              Note also, that KOMA-Script will remove the definition
